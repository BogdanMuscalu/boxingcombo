## Description

This repository is for a mobile app that randomly chooses combinations of strikes and plays them out so you can just follow.

You set whether you're hitting pads or just shadow boxing, then choose the number of seconds between combinations.

When shadow boxing it speaks combinations of 3 or 4 punches and a kick or knee. When hitting pads it's just two punches, one for each arm.

It's in the Romanian language. Easily compiled with PhoneGap.
