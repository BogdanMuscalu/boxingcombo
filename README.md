## Description

A mobile app that randomly chooses combinations of strikes and plays them out so you can just follow.

You set the number of seconds between combinations and whether you're hitting pads or just shadow boxing.

When shadow boxing it speaks combinations of 3 or 4 punches and a kick or knee. When hitting pads it's just two punches, one for each arm.

It's in the Romanian language.
